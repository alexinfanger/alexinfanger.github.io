On this page, we show the eigenvalues of the various models we are studying.

We can either fix $$\lambda$$ and $$\mu$$ so that $$\rho$$ is changing as you change $$s$$, or let those parameters change as you change $$s$$ so that $$\rho$$ is fixed. We will do both. For the former we'll fix $$\lambda=\mu=1$$ and let $$s$$ change.

Next we fix $$\lambda$$ but very $$\mu$$ so that $$\frac{\lambda}{\mu s} =.8$$.
